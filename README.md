# Attendance-Monitoring-System
The AI-powered Attendance Monitoring System automates student attendance tracking using real-time face recognition. It utilizes two USB webcams connected to a PC to capture facial images from multiple angles during scheduled classroom sessions. The system is built using Python and features a Tkinter-based GUI for live camera feed display, session control, and PostgreSQL table management. YOLO is employed for accurate face detection, while DeepFace (Facenet model) are used for face recognition. Captured images and attendance logs are stored in a PostgreSQL database and synchronized with Firebase for cloud backup. The system also sends automated email notifications to parents for students marked absent or late. Additionally, it supports session-based folder creation, image saving, and automatic uploading to a web server and GitHub via HTTP POST and GitHub API, making it a complete and scalable solution for classroom attendance management.
